# nmf-topic-extraction

The **nfm_topics** notebook covers a small exploratory analysis on the articles that I scraped from [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/) using the SpringerLink scraper with disciplines present on this [repository](https://github.com/GustavoGil13/springer-link-scraper). Then I attempted to use the NMF method to extract topics from the articles abstracts.
